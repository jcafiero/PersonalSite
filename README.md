An interactive version of my resume that I've developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Any feedback can be sent to jcafiero@stevens.edu!

**NOTE:** this site hasn't been updated in a while, so it has been renamed to be prev.jcafiero.github.io. The most up to date resume site can be found in the new jcafiero.github.io repository.
